**Project Title: UPI Payment System in C**

**Description:**

This project is a UPI (Unified Payments Interface) payment system implemented in C language, designed to provide users with a seamless and secure digital payment experience. The program allows users to create new accounts and manage their credentials effectively by offering a feature to change passwords whenever necessary.

A key aspect of this system is its focus on transaction transparency. The program not only facilitates payments but also keeps a record of the most recent transactions. Users can conveniently view the details of their last three transactions, ensuring they stay informed about their financial activities.

The UPI Payment System is designed with simplicity and user-friendliness in mind, making it accessible even for those who are not tech-savvy. This project demonstrates the core functionalities required for a basic digital payment system and provides a solid foundation for further enhancements and features.

**Features:**
1. Account creation for new users.
2. Secure password management with a change password option.
3. Display of details for the last three transactions.

This project is an excellent demonstration of how the C language can be utilized to create practical and essential financial tools in the digital age.
